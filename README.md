# Web-styles-guide
-----------
## Why am i decide to create this webcite?
I create this website to improve my skills in web design and practice to use css and html. As you may understood, this site created with html and css only. 

## Who is benefit from my site?
I think, the junior or tranee web developers will be interested to explore my site. They can get inspired to create something interesting or they can find some interesting things whitch they can use at their own projects.

## What new things did I learn while createing this website?
I use a lot of new things, but the most memorable are using ```html <div>``` constructor and css ```css @media``` field to upgrade my website and allow my friends enjoing my website from mobile phone! Aslo i knew about dimensions which depends on window size (vh and vw) and practice to connect the fonts from computer.

## What topicks do you need to work on?
I think I not fully understand div constructor, sometimes I confounding in div sizes, margins and paddings. When I create mobile version, i cannot get rid of overflow-x, althought i have tried to find a mistake for a several hours. So i decide to use ```html <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">```. I think that this is a bad practise,and i will try to solve it in future. 

## Directory structure

File/folder    name | Description

## Inspirations

I get inspired from [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) and [Material Design Blog](https://material.io/blog/). 

## Conclusions
I try to create website whitch will be similar by website from my inspirations. I undestand, that my way is starting and i will develop to create the same websites like Material design and maybe even better!
